# Time complexity

## It is used to measure efficiency of an algorithm in terms of speed as the input size grows

## Time Complexity != Time taken to run because that time is dependent on machine and language

## Let's Take Example of binary search vs Linear Search

### Which one do you think is faster? and why??

# The outright answer says that ofc binary search is much more faster and efficient but The true answer is it depends on use case
